//== Set up email notifications 

//You can send specific types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when youâ€™re not logged into BlueXP. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your BlueXP account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity.

//NOTE: Sending email notifications is not supported when the Connector is installed in a site without internet access.

//By default, BlueXP Account Admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" notifications. 

//For instructions on configuring email settings, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html#set-email-notification-settings[Configure email settings in BlueXP^]
