With BlueXP alerts, only an ONTAP license is required. 

Use an ONTAP "bring your own license" (BYOL), which is a NetApp License File (NLF) that you obtain from your NetApp Sales Rep. You can use the license serial number to get the BYOL activated in BlueXP digital wallet. 



== Bring your own license (BYOL)

If you want to bring your own license (BYOL), you'll need to purchase the license, get the NetApp License File (NLF), and add the license to BlueXP digital wallet. 

*Add your license file to BlueXP digital wallet*

After you've purchased your BlueXP alerts license from your NetApp Sales Rep, you activate the license by entering the BlueXP alerts serial number and NetApp Support Site (NSS) account information.

== Update your BlueXP license when it expires

If your licensed term is nearing the expiration date, you'll be notified in the BlueXP alerts UI. You can update your BlueXP alerts license before it expires so that there is no interruption in your ability to access your scanned data.

TIP: This message also appears in BlueXP digital wallet and in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html#monitoring-operations-status-using-the-notification-center[Notifications]. 

.Steps

. Select the chat icon in the lower-right of BlueXP to request an extension to your term. You can also send an email to request an update to your license.
+
After you pay for the license and it is registered with the NetApp Support Site, BlueXP automatically updates the license in the BlueXP digital wallet and the Data Services Licenses page will reflect the change in 5 to 10 minutes.

. If BlueXP can't automatically update the license (for example, when installed in a dark site), then you'll need to manually upload the license file.
+
.. You can obtain the license file from the NetApp Support Site.
.. Access the BlueXP digital wallet.
.. Select the *Data Services Licenses* tab, select the *Actions ...* icon for the service serial number you are updating, and select *Update License*.
