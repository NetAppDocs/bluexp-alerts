With BlueXP alerts, you can use different licensing plans.

You can use the following license types:

* Sign up for a 90-day free trial.
* Bring your own license (BYOL), which is a NetApp License File (NLF) that you obtain from your NetApp Sales Rep. You can use the license serial number to get the BYOL activated in BlueXP digital wallet. 


After the free trial ends or the license expires, you can still do the following in the service:

* View workloads and workload health.
* View ONTAP alerts. 

== Try it out using a 90-day free trial
You can try BlueXP alerts out by using a 90-day free trial. You must be an account administrator to start the free trial. 

NOTE: No capacity limits are enforced during the trial.  

You can get a license at any time and you will not be charged until the 90-day trial ends. To continue after the 90-day trial, you'll need to purchase a BYOL license. 

During the trial, you have full functionality.
