BlueXP alerts is a service that enables you to view issues or potential risks in your NetApp ONTAP environment. With the service, you can drill into details using NetApp System Manager.

//NOTE: THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED AS A TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW.  With this preview offering, NetApp reserves the right to modify offering details, contents, and timeline before General Availability.   

== What you can do with BlueXP alerts 

The BlueXP alerts service helps you stay informed about risks or potential risk in your ONTAP storage environment. The BlueXP alerts service provides information about these severities and impact areas: 

* *Severities*: Critical, Error, Warning, Informational
* *Impact areas*: Capacity, Performance, Availability, Security, Configuration

== Benefits of using BlueXP alerts 

BlueXP alerts offers the following benefits: 

* Get alerts about your ONTAP storage across clusters.
* View alerts in the same BlueXP UI that you use for other services.
* Drill into alerts on ONTAP clusters -- start from BlueXP alerts and see details in NetApp System Manager. 


== Cost 

NetApp doesnâ€™t charge you for using the trial version of BlueXP alerts. The full version of BlueXP alerts can be used with a NetApp ONTAP license.

== Licensing 

With BlueXP alerts, you can use different licensing plans including a free trial or bring your own license.

The BlueXP alerts service requires a NetApp ONTAP license.

| Feature
| Description


| *IDENTIFY* | * Finds all customer on-premises NAS (NFS and CIFS protocols) and Cloud Volumes ONTAP data connected to BlueXP.
* Identifies customer data from ONTAP and SnapCenter service APIs and associates it with workloads. Learn more about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-family/[ONTAP^] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/index.html[SnapCenter Software^].

 * Discovers each volume's current protection level of NetApp Snapshot copies and backup policies as well as any on-box detection capabilities. The service then associates this protection posture with the workloads by using BlueXP backup and recovery, ONTAP services, and NetApp technologies such as Autonomous alerts, FPolicy, Backup policies, and Snapshot policies.

* Assigns a business priority to each workload based on automatically discovered protection levels and recommends protection policies for workloads based on their business priority.
//* Assigns a business priority to each workload based on discovered protection levels by using BlueXP classification (formerly Cloud Data Sense). 
// Learn more about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/index.html[BlueXP classification^].


| *PROTECT* | * Actively monitors workloads and orchestrates the use of BlueXP backup and recovery, SnapCenter, and ONTAP APIs by applying policies to each of the identified workloads.

| *DETECT* | * Detects potential attacks with an integrated machine learning (ML) model that detects potentially anomalous encryption and activity. 
//| *DETECT* | * Detects potential attacks with an integrated machine learning (ML) model that detects potentially anomalous encryption and activity. Applies alerts technology by using NetApp Advanced Ransomware Detection, a machine learning (ML) model that detects malicious file encryptions. 
* Provides dual-layer detection that starts with detecting potential ransomware attacks in the primary storage and responding to abnormal activities by taking additional automated Snapshot copies to create the nearest data restore points. The service provides the ability to dig deeper to identify potential attacks with greater precision without impacting the performance of the primary workloads. 
* Determines the specific suspect files and maps that attack to the associated workloads, using ONTAP, Autonomous alerts and FPolicy technologies. 
//* Determines the specific suspect files and maps that attack to the associated workloads, using ONTAP, Autonomous alerts, FPolicy, and Advanced Ransomware Detection. 

|*RESPOND* | * Shows relevant data, such as file activity, user activity, and entropy, to help you complete forensic reviews about the attack.
* Initiates quick Snapshot copies by using NetApp technologies and products such as ONTAP, Autonomous alerts and FPolicy. 
//* Initiates quick Snapshot copies by using NetApp technologies and products such as ONTAP, Autonomous alerts, FPolicy, and Advanced Ransomware Detection. 
|*RECOVER* | //* Verifies that backup data on secondary storage is clean and scans for known ransomware signatures in the data.
* Determines the best Snapshot or backup and recommends the best recovery point actual (RPA) by using BlueXP backup and recovery, ONTAP, Autonomous alerts and FPolicy technologies and services. 
//* Determines the best Snapshot or backup and recommends the best recovery point actual (RPA) by using BlueXP backup and recovery, ONTAP, Autonomous alerts, FPolicy, and Advanced Ransomware Detection technologies and services. 
* Orchestrates the recovery of workloads including VMs, file shares, and databases with application consistency. 
|*GOVERN* | * Assigns the alerts strategies
* Helps you monitor the outcomes.
