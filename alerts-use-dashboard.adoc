The BlueXP alerts service provides at-a-glance information about the health of your ONTAP environment. You can quickly identify ONTAP clusters that have low capacity or low performance, gauge the extent of availability, determine availability, and identify security risks.

The BlueXP alerts service provides information about these severities and impact areas: 

* *Severities*: Critical, Error, Warning, Informational
* *Impact areas*: Capacity, Performance, Availability, Security, Configuration

== Alerts you might see
Here are some of the alerts that the service provides.
